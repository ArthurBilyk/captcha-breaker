#summary Why some captchas are so easy to break


= Details =

Here are some of the reasons why some captchas are really really easy to break.

1. Background is the same color. No gradient or patterns.
2. Font is not distorted.
3. Letters are all nicely next to each other and always at the same place.

So if you want to make it harder then.

1. Have a changing background. Add gradients, patterns etc and make sure the background is different every single time.
2. Distort the font or at least write the letters randomly across the image without a specific pattern.
